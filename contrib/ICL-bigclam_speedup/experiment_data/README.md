The directory contains the code for and data generated in our experiments:

* The file `parallelize_runtime.csv` contains data generated in the experiment described in Section 5.1 of the pre-print / Section 4.1 of the workshop paper (showing parallelizing the CA stage speeds up the implementation);
* The file `parallelize_speedup_limit_test.csv` contains data generated in the experiment described in Section 5.3 of the pre-print (exploring the limit in speed up with parallel computing);
* The file `figure_3_proportion_time_spent.R` contains the R script that generates Figure 3 in the pre-print / Figure 2 in the workshop paper (which has a different legend placement);
* The file `figure_6_box_plot.R` contains the R script that generates Figure 6 in the pre-print / Figure 4 in the workshop paper;
* The file `figure_7_extra_speedup_limit.ipynb` contains the Jupyter notebook (Python) that generates Figure 7 in the pre-print; and
* The file `table_3.R` contains the R script that produces Table 3 in the pre-print and the workshop paper and its associated t-test results.

For instructions on how to run the R scripts and Jupyter notebook, as well as details for the pre-print / workshop paper, please refer to the README file one level up.
