Node IDs can be arbitrary non-negative integers. Edges have IDs.
There can be more than one directed edge from one source node to a destination
node.
Self loops (one per node) are allowed as well as multiple (parallel) edges.
Nodes and edges can have attributes/data associated with them.
The attributes can be added dynamically at runtime.
The directed multigraph data structure is implemented using sorted adjacency
lists.
This means adding a node takes constant time, while adding an edge takes
linear time (since adjacency list is kept sorted) in the node degree.
Accessing arbitrary node takes constant time and accessing any edge takes
logarithmic time in the node degree.
The attributes are organized in a columnar store, where each attribute column
is defined for all the nodes or edges in the network.
