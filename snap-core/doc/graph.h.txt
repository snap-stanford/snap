/// TUNGraph::Class
Node IDs can be arbitrary non-negative integers. Nodes and edges have no attributes/data associated with them.
There is at most one undirected edge between a pair of nodes.
Self loops (one per node) are allowed but multiple (parallel) edges are not.
The undirected graph data structure is implemented using sorted adjacency lists.
This means adding a node takes constant time, while adding an edge takes linear time (since adjacency list is kept sorted) in the node degree.
Accessing arbitrary node takes constant time and accessing any edge takes logarithmic time in the node degree.
///

/// TUNGraph::TNodeI::GetInNId
Range of NodeN: 0 <= NodeN < GetInDeg(). Since the graph is undirected
GetInNId(), GetOutNId() and GetNbrNId() all give the same output.

/// TUNGraph::New

///

/// TUNGraph::AddNode (int NId = -1)
Returns the ID of the node being added.
If NId is -1, node ID is automatically assigned.
Aborts, if a node with ID NId already exists.
///

/// TUNGraph::AddNodeUnchecked (int NId = -1)
Returns -1, if the node NId already exists.
Otherwise, it returns the ID of the node being added.
If NId is -1, node ID is automatically assigned.
///

/// TUNGraph::AddNode-1 (const int& NId, const TIntV& NbrNIdV)
Returns the ID of the node being added.
If NId is -1, node ID is automatically assigned.
Aborts, if a node with ID NId already exists.

The operation can create inconsistent graphs when the neighboring nodes
in NbrNIdV vector do not exist.
Use TUNGraph::IsOk to check that the resulting graph is consistent
after the operation.
///

/// TUNGraph::AddNode-2 (const int& NId, const TVecPool<TInt>& Pool, const int& NIdVId)
Returns the ID of the node being added.
If NId is -1, node ID is automatically assigned.
Aborts, if a node with ID NId already exists.

The operation can create inconsistent graphs when the neighboring nodes
stored in the Pool vector are not explicitly added to the graph.
Use TUNGraph::IsOk to check that the resulting graph is consistent.
///

/// TUNGraph::DelNode
If the node of ID NId does not exist the function aborts.
///

/// TUNGraph::AddEdge
If the edge already exists return -2. If the edge was successfully added return -1.
Normally the function should return an ID of the edge added but since edges in TUNGraph have no IDs we return -1.
The function aborts if SrcNId or DstNId are not nodes in the graph.
///

/// TUNGraph::AddEdgeUnchecked
Returns -1.
The method assumes that SrcNId and DstNId are existing nodes in the graph and
adds new neighbor values at the end of their adjacency vectors.
No checks are performed to verify these assumptions.
Adjacency vectors must be sorted and have duplicates removed after a sequence
of these operations to assure consistency of data structures.
///

/// TUNGraph::DelEdge
If the edge (SrcNId, DstNId) does not exist in the graph function still completes.
But the function aborts if SrcNId or DstNId are not nodes in the graph.
///

/// TUNGraph::GetEI
Note that since this is an undirected graph GetEI(SrcNId, DstNId) has the same effect as GetEI(DstNId, SrcNId).
///

/// TUNGraph::Defrag
After performing many node and edge insertions and deletions to a graph,
the graph data structure will be fragmented in memory.
This function compacts down the graph data structure and frees unneeded memory.
