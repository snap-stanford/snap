/// LoadPajek
Function supports both the 1 edge per line (<source> <destination> <weight>) as well as the 1 node per line (<source> <destination1> <destination2> ...) formats.
///

/// SaveGViz_NIdColorH
  Save a graph in GraphVizp .DOT format.
  @param NIdColorH Maps node ids to node colors (see GraphViz documentation for more details).
///

/// SaveGViz_NIdLabelH
  Save a graph in GraphVizp .DOT format.
  @param NIdLabelH Maps node ids to node string labels.
///


/// LoadEdgeList
  Whitespace separated file of several columns: ... <source node id> ... <destination node id> ...
  SrcColId and DstColId are column indexes of source/destination (integer!) node ids.
  This means there is one edge per line and node IDs are assumed to be integers.
///

/// LoadEdgeList_Separator
'Separator' separated file of several columns: ... <source node id> ... <destination node id> ...
SrcColId and DstColId are column indexes of source/destination (integer!) node ids.
This means there is one edge per line and node IDs are assumed to be integers.
///

/// LoadEdgeListStr
  Whitespace separated file of several columns: ... <source node id> ... <destination node id> ...
  SrcColId and DstColId are column indexes of source/destination (string) node ids.
  This means there is one edge per line and node IDs can be arbitrary STRINGs.
  Note that the mapping of node names to ids is discarded.
///

/// LoadEdgeListStr_StrToNIdH
  Whitespace separated file of several columns: ... <source node id> ... <destination node id> ...
  SrcColId and DstColId are column indexes of source/destination (string) node ids.
  This means there is one edge per line and node IDs can be arbitrary STRINGs.
  The mapping of strings to node ids in stored in StrToNIdH.
  To map between node names and ids use: NId = StrToNIdH.GetKeyId(NodeName) and TStr NodeName = StrToNIdH.GetKey(NId);
///

/// LoadConnList
  Whitespace separated file of several columns: <source node id> <destination node id1> <destination node id2> ...
  First column of each line contains a source node id followed by ids of the destination nodes.
  For example, '1 2 3' encodes edges 1-->2 and 1-->3. Note that this format allows for saving isolated nodes.
///  


/// LoadConnListStr
  Whitespace separated file of several columns: <source node name> <destination node name 1> <destination node name 2> ... 
  First colum of each line contains a source node name followed by ids of the destination nodes.
  For example, 'A B C' encodes edges A-->B and A-->C. Note that this format allows for saving isolated nodes.
  @StrToNIdH stores the mapping from node names to node ids.
