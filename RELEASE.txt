Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP) is a general purpose, high
performance system for graph and network manipulation and analysis.

This file contains a high-level description of changes in SNAP releases.

Release 1.11, Dec 21, 2012

- added new examples netinf, infopath
- added new advanced modules cascnetinf, cascdynetinf
- added new distribution functions to glib-core/dt.h::TRnd: GetRayleigh(),
  GetWeibull()
- added demo programs for graph input/output (gio.h), graph generators
  (ggen.h), THash
- added tests for graph input/output (gio.h), graph generators (ggen.h), THash
- unified the names of intermediate files for demos and tests to demo*.dat
  and test*.dat
- added cases to test edge iterator with very few nodes
- expanded TUNGraph test to include graphs with loops and the number of
  edges in such graphs
- added ManipulateEdges test for TUNGraph
- added test in TUNGraph for checking edge iterator following deletion
- added OSX Xcode project
- updated snap-test Xcode project with gtest code completion/syntax.
- improved tutorial and test Makefiles to work on Mac OS X
- improved Snap.o make rule, added dependencies for *.h, *.cpp in glib-core
  and snap-core
- improved demo Makefile so that individual targets do not need to be
  specified
- added path to snap-exp to examples makefiles
- changed function parameters in TStrPool to const reference
- added assertion for DegSeq vector to be sorted
- added an assertion for edges in random graphs to prevent infinite loops
- fixed #27 - No node checking when load Epinions in signnet.cpp
- fixed #28 - no TGraphViz class in signnet.cpp
- fixed #29 - no check for inserting node in bfsdfs.h
- fixed #17 "example/cliques" does not compile with gcc 4.7
- fixed #21, undetected 32-bit overflow in TGraphAnf<PGraph>::InitAnfBits(),
  the calculation is now done in 64-bits and an exception is thrown if the
  final result is more than 32-bit
- fixed bug in LoadPajek for graph files with colors
- changed EFailR() to FailR() when out of memory
- included bd.h in all files that use Class... macros, so that doxygen
  correctly documents those classes
- added #7, add Snap version number to reference manuals
- implemented #8, improve the front page for reference manuals
- added .gitignore file for Xcode project

Release 1.10, Oct 15, 2012

- fixed TUNGraph to return correct number of edges, not backward compatible.
  This version is not able to read binary TUNGraphs, saved by previous SNAP
  versions.
- added a new example graphhash
- fixed #13, GHash incorrectly handles non-existent keys
- fixed #12, Graphviz keeps outputting a PostScript file on non-Windows
- fixed #15, bug in netevol.cpp
- fixed #14, TSnap::GenCircle creates self-loops
- fixed a bug in TSnap::GetBfsTree which failed for revised AddNode()
- included "<new>" in unicode.h to support Xcode with the Apple compiler
- fixed bug in TUNGraph:BegEI(), some edges could be missed by the iterator

Release 1.9.2, Oct 2, 2012

- removed a default parameter in triad.h so that the code compiles in
  Visual Studio 2010
- in source code converted all 8bit characters to 7bit characters \xnn

Release 1.9.1, Sep 28, 2012

- fixed name mismatch between GetUniq... and CntUniq... to CntUniq...
- reversed the changes in centr.h:GetNodeEcc() name and definition to pre-1.9

Release 1.9, Sep 26, 2012

- names of functions in gviz.h have been changed, not backward compatible
- neighbor abbreviations have been changed thoughout the code,
    nbh -> nbr, Nbh -> Nbr, not backward compatible
- a new class TBPGraph has been added to support bipartite graphs
- new examples have been added agmgen, circles, kronem, magfit, maggen
- code automatically detects gnuplot version to address "set ticks"
- makefiles automatically detect OS version
- snap directory has been split to snap-core, snap-adv, snap-exp
- glib directory has been split to glib-core and glib-adv
- reference manuals have been created for users and developers
- tutorials have been created for many classes
- tests have been created for many classes
- programming guide has been created for developers
- code has been changed to remove compilation warnings
- merged with the latest glib version
- numerous code improvements and bug fixes
