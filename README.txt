========================================================================

Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP) is a general purpose, high
performance system for analysis and manipulation of large networks.
SNAP is written in C++ and it scales to massive graphs with hundreds
of millions of nodes and billions of edges.

Code compiles under Windows (Microsoft Visual Studio, CygWin with gcc) and
Linux and Mac (gcc). Use the SnapExamples.vcproj or provided makefiles.

Some of applications expect that GnuPlot and GraphViz are installed and
accessible -- paths are in the system PATH variable or they reside in the
working directory.

Example applications are available in the examples directory and
described at http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/description.html.

To compile from the command line, execute:
  make all : compiles all sample applications

To compile on Mac OSX, using Xcode:
  1. From the Toolbar, select Scheme (e.g. 'bigclam').
  2. Product -> Build.  (or Cmd + B).
  3. Run executable via the command line; or
     Choose the scheme's executable (Product -> Edit Scheme -> Run -> Info)
     and run: Product -> Run (or Cmd + R). 
     Note: If using Gnuplot, add the PATH to the scheme's environment variables.
     or create symlink to /usr/bin:
     sudo ln -s <gnuplot_dir>/gnuplot /usr/bin/
  For code completion, the "docs" target has been created which includes all
  Snap-related files and example programs.

SNAP documentation:
  http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/doc.html

The library defines Graphs (nodes and edges) and Networks (graph with data
associated with nodes and edges).

Graph types:
  TNGraph : 
  	directed graph (single directed edge between a pair of nodes)
  TNEGraph : 
  	directed multi-graph (any number of directed edges between a pair of
	nodes)
  TUNGraph : 
  	undirected graph (single undirected edge between a pair of nodes)

Network types:
  TNodeNet<TNodeData> : 
  	like TNGraph but with TNodeData object for each node
  TNodeEdgeNet<TNodeData, TEdgeData> : 
  	like TNEGraph but with TNodeData object for each node and TEdgeData
	object for each edge
  TBigNet<TNodeData> : 
  	memory efficient implementation of TNodeNet (avoids memory
	fragmentation)
